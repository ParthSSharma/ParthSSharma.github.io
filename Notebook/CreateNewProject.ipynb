    "## Creating a new project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get your Windows machine setup as described on [this webpage](https://parthssharma.github.io/Pico/Setup.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open a Developer PowerShell for Visual Studio by navigating to `Windows > Visual Studio 2019 > Developer PowerShell for VS 2019`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Navigate to the directory in which you've installed `pico-sdk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a new directory to house the test project alongside the `pico-sdk` directory by running the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir test\n",
    "cd test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Copy the `pico_sdk_import.cmake` file from the `external` folder in your `pico-sdk` installation to your test project folder by running:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cp ../pico-sdk/external/pico_sdk_import.cmake .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Add a new file called `test.c` to the directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```C\n",
    "    #include <stdio.h>\n",
    "    #include \"pico/stdlib.h\"\n",
    "    #include \"hardware/gpio.h\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    const uint LED_PIN = 25;\n",
    "\n",
    "    int main(){\n",
    "        stdio_init_all();\n",
    "\n",
    "        gpio_init(LED_PIN);\n",
    "        gpio_set_dir(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);\n",
    "\n",
    "        while(1){\n",
    "            gpio_put(LED_PIN, 0);\n",
    "            sleep_ms(250);\n",
    "            gpio_put(LED_PIN, 1);\n",
    "            puts(\"Hello world\\n\");\n",
    "            sleep_ms(1000);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Add another file called `CMakeLists.txt` to the same directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)\n",
    "\n",
    "    include(pico_sdk_import.cmake)\n",
    "\n",
    "    project(test_project)\n",
    "\n",
    "    pico_sdk_init()\n",
    "\n",
    "    add_executable(test test.c)\n",
    "\n",
    "    pico_enable_stdio_usb(test 1)\n",
    "    pico_enable_stdio_uart(test 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "    pico_add_extra_outputs(test)\n",
    "\n",
    "    target_link_libraries(test pico_stdlib)\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "## Building the project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Developer PowerShell for Visual Studio, navigate to your test project repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Build by running the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    mkdir build\n",
    "    cd build\n",
    "    cmake -G \"NMake Makefiles\" ..\n",
    "    nmake\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Note:** If, on the second build, you get errors thrown due to syntax in makefiles, run `nmake clean` before again running `nmake`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Within the build directory, you will now find a `hello_world` directory. You will find directories for each of the other example projects too. These folders will contain the `ELF`, `bin`, and `uf2` target files for each project. The `uf2` target file can be dragged-and-dropped directly onto an RP2040 board attached to your PC via USB, as explained [here](https://parthssharma.github.io/Pico/Setup.html#Programming-the-Pico).\n",

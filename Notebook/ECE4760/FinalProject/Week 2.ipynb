    "During week 2 of the project, we added some moving obstacles and the dino in the form of some boxes. We then created a Python GUI to interact with the game. The GUI has 3 buttons:\n",
    "- Start button to start the game\n",
    "- Jump button to make the dino jump\n",
    "- Restart button to restart the game in case the dino dies\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used the GUI for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we had our GUI ready, we implemented the jump as well as the collision logic in our code. Once it was up and running, we implemented the voice control feature using ADC input and FFT algorithm.\n",

    "Just like with implementing the ground, we implemented the obstacles using a `struct`. However, there is a catch. The ground was implemeted using an array while we only used single variable to implement the obstacle (and reuse it to bring in the next obstacle). We also used a new variable called `obsType` to keep a track of the type of obstacle (we have 3 different types based on their width and height)."

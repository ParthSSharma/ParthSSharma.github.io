    "During week 2 of the project, we added some moving obstacles and the dino in the form of some boxes. We then created a Python GUI to interact with the game. The GUI has 3 buttons:\n",

    "#### 7. Implementing the Voice Control Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "This was probably the most challenging part of the entire project. In order to get the voice input, we used the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). The ADC was triggered by a timer interrupt. Once we got the ADC input in an array, we fed the array to a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) function. The FFT function computes the FFT of the input and provides a range of frequency bins. We then computed which bin has the highest power and then used the bin to compute the frequency range with most power. In order to use the ADC, we used the following parameters. Here `F` is the clock frequency and `Fs` is the sampling frequency."

    "# Week 3\n",
    "\n",
    "During week 3 of the project, we worked on replacing the dino and obstacle blocks with bitmap images of a cartoon dinosaur and 3 different types of cactii to make it aesthetically pleasing. In order to do so, we first used the predefined `tft_drawBitmap()` function and successfully implemented the dino and cactii graphics in the game. However, we realized that the function is not optimized and takes a lot of CPU cycles to run. Thus, we digged into the header files and created our own optimized function for drawing bitmaps.\n",

    "Next, we implemented the live score and high score functionality in the game.\n",

    "#### 2. Converting images to bitmaps\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to display these images in the game, we needed to convert them in a form which a microcontroller could understand. This form is known as a `bitmap`. A bitmap is basically an array of pixels where each bit of the array signifies whether a pixel is dark or light. If the pixel is light, the bit is set to 1 and if the pixel is dark, the bit is set to 0. In order to conserve space, the pixels are represented in a hexdecimal format so that each element of the array represents a series of 8 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to convert these PNG images in the bitmap format, we used [LCD Image Converter](https://lcd-image-converter.riuson.com/en/about/). We followed the following steps for this conversion:\n",
    "- Open the desired PNG image in the software.\n",
    "- Click on `Options > Conversion`.\n",
    "- Set the preset to `Monochrome` and click `Show Preview`.\n",
    "- This will open up a new window which displays the 1D array of the desired 2D bitmap image."

Every single array is of the type `const unsigned char`. We used `const` because the bitmap will remain constant throught the execution of the program and will be stored in the flash memory."

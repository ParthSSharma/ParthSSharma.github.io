    "During week 3 of the project, we worked on replacing the dino and obstacle blocks with bitmap images of a cartoon dinosaur and 3 different types of cactii to make it aesthetically pleasing. In order to do so, we first used the predefined `tft_drawBitmap()` function and successfully implemented the dino and cactii graphics in the game. However, we realized that the function is not optimized and takes a lot of CPU cycles to run. Thus, we digged into the header files and created our own optimized function for drawing bitmaps.\n",

If the pixel is light, the bit is set to 1 and if the pixel is dark, the bit is set to 0. In order to conserve space, the pixels are represented in a hexdecimal format so that each element of the array represents a series of 8 pixels.\n",

    "#### 5. Optimization of the `tft_drawBitmap()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to optimize the function, we dug into the library and studied how each function is implemented. Particularly, the `tft_drawBitmap()` function is implemented in the following manner:\n",
    "- Define a `byteWidth` and counter variables `i` & `j`.\n",
    "- For all the elements in the given bitmap, check if the given pixel is set.\n",
    "- If the given pixel is set, draw a pixel of the given color using the `tft_drawPixel()` function.\n",
    "- Otherwise, do nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this doesn't look particularly unoptimized. However, digging in deeper, we found that calling the `tft_drawPixel()` function for all the pixels is pretty time consuming as the `tft_drawPixel()` function is implemented as follows:\n",
    "- Configure the row address.\n",
    "- Configure the column address.\n",
    "- Send the color to be drawn with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This row and column address configuration for all the pixels is quite time consuming and redundant. On the other hand, comparing it to the `tft_fillRect()` function, this function is implemented as follows:\n",
    "- Set the boundary condition for the rectangle.\n",
    "- Set the address window.\n",
    "- For all the pixels, send the color to be drawn with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is extremely optimized as we need to set the address window only once. Therefore, we combined the two functions to create a new function called `drawBitmap()` which takes in the same set of arguments as the `tft_drawBitmap()` function (and is therefore interchangeable). It was implemented as follows:\n",
    "- Set the boundary condition for the rectangle.\n",
    "- Set the address window.\n",
    "- For all the elements in the given bitmap, check if the given pixel is set.\n",
    "- If the given pixel is set, send the color directly to the TFT using the `tft_spiwrite16()` function.\n",
    "- Otherwise, send the `0xFFFF` directly to the TFT using the `tft_spiwrite16()` function to draw a black background.\n",

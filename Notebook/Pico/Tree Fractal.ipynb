    "# Tree Fractal\n",
    "\n",
    "This program was my attempt to draw fractals on a VGA screen using Prof. Hunter Adam's [VGA Library](https://vha3.github.io/Pico/VGA/VGA.html) for the RaspberryPi Pico. The resources for the project include the [C SDK User Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and Prof. Hunter's [website](https://vha3.github.io/). I also used the [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/) series by [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) as a starting point for studying fractals.\n",

    "## About Fractals\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Nature of Code's [fractal page](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/), the term **fractal** (from the Latin fractus, meaning “broken”) was coined by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975. In his seminal work “The Fractal Geometry of Nature,” he defines a fractal as “a rough or fragmented geometric shape that can be split into parts, each of which is (at least approximately) a reduced-size copy of the whole.” In short, a fractal is a shape which when divided into various parts, each part can represent the figure as a whole.\n",

    "## Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "The repeated application of a rule to successive results is known as recursion. One of the most famous applications for recursion is the calculation of factorical. The factorial of a natural number is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "n! &= n \\times (n-1)! \\\\\n",
    "0! &= 1\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, solving for 5! looks like:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "5! &= 5 \\times 4! \\\\\n",
    "5! &= 5 \\times 4 \\times 3! \\\\\n",
    "5! &= 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2! \\\\\n",
    "5! &= 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1! \\\\\n",
    "5! &= 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 \\\\\n",
    "5! &= 120\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: Recursions must always have a base case and that too at a reasonable depth, else it will cause a stack overflow error._\n",

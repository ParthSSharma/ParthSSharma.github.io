    "# Multi Core Contention Prevention\n",
    "\n",
    "RP2040 has Dual Cortex M0+ processor cores which can run upto 133MHz independent of each other. However, the second core (core 1) is asleep on boot and needs to be waken up by a function call from the first core (core 0). This program demonstrates the prevention of contention between core 0 and core 1 for a shared memory space using spin locks. The demonstration of contention can be found [here](https://parthssharma.github.io/Pico/MultiCoreContention.html). The resources for the project include the [C SDK User Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and Prof. Hunter's [website](https://vha3.github.io/).\n",

    "The core 1 function is the function which runs on the core 1 once it wakes up from its slumber. In other terms, this function is the `main()` function for core 1 and runs independent of the actual `main()` function running on core 0 (unless there is an intra-core communication). The `core1_entry()` function grabs the spin lock (if it is unlocked) and checks if `i` is less than 100000000. If it is, it increments both `i` and `core1` and releases the spinlock. It then proceeds to repeat the process for eternity. As long as the spin lock is acquired by core 1, core 0 will not be able to acquire it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additional information\n",
    "\n",
    "As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock): A spinlock is a lock which causes a thread trying to acquire it to simply wait in a loop (\"spin\") while repeatedly checking if the lock is available. Since the thread remains active but is not performing a useful task, the use of such a lock is a kind of busy waiting. Once acquired, spinlocks will usually be held until they are explicitly released, although in some implementations they may be automatically released if the thread being waited on (the one which holds the lock) blocks, or \"goes to sleep\"."

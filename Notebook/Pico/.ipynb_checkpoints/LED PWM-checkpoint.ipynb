    "The `wrapHandler()` is the function that is called every time the PWM timer throws an interrupt. This function has two `static` variables: `fade` and `rise`. The `fade` variable is used to keep a track of the brightness level of the LED. The `rise` variable is used to keep a track of the state whether the LED is fading in or fading out. Since I wanted the change in brightness to be linearly visible, I used the square of the fade value to determine the duty cycle. I used the `pwm_set_gpio_level()` function to change the duty cycle. Since the PWM in the RP2040 is 16-bit wide, it can take in values from 0 to 65536.  "

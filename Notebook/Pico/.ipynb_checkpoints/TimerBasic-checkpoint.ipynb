    "This program was an introduction to the timer the system timer peripheral on RP2040. It provides a global microsecond timebase for the system, and generates interrupts based on this timebase. This programs fetches and prints the absolute time (the time elapsed since boot) on the serial monitor. The resources for the project include the [C SDK User Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and Prof. Hunter's [website](https://vha3.github.io/).\n",

    "- A single 64-bit counter, incrementing once per microsecond\n",
    "- This counter can be read from a pair of latching registers, for race-free reads over a 32-bit bus.\n",
    "- Four alarms: match on the lower 32 bits of counter, IRQ on match.\n",

All libraries within the SDK are INTERFACE libraries.\n",

    "# Generating Sine wave using DMA\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was meant to provide an objective through which to build understanding of DMA and SPI channels on the RP2040. For this project, I chained two DMA channels. One of those channels is triggered by a timer which is configured to overflow at a fixed given interval. This channel moves data from a sine table to the SPI transmit buffer. The SPI channel is configured to automatically transmit any new data which appears in its transmit buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other DMA channel is chained to the first. When the first DMA channel finishes traversing the sine table, it triggers the second channel. This channel writes to the *control registers* of the first DMA channel. In particular, it writes to the `AL3_TRANS_COUNT_TRIG` register associated with the other DMA channel. This control register sets the number of transactions that the first DMA channel should execute (the length of the sine table). Because it is a trigger register, writing any non-zero value to this register automatically triggers the DMA channel to start. So, these two channels ping-pong off one another. The first finishes and triggers the second, the second writes to the control/trigger register of the first. The consequence is a persistent sine wave output from the DAC, with no code executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used an [MCP4822 DAC](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20002249B.pdf) to generate a sine wave of a given frequency. The Pico transmits data to the DAC using SPI. The resources for the project include the [C SDK User Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and Prof. Hunter's [website](https://vha3.github.io/).\n",

    "#### Configuring the data DMA channel\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to before, I declared an object of type `dma_channel_config` and name this one `c2`. I started with the default configurations, and then changed some of these configurations with subsequent calls to various `channel_config` functions from the SDK.\n",
    "- I set the transfer data size to 16 bits, since that's what the DAC expects.\n",
    "- I enabled read incrementing, and disabled write incrementing. This means that the DMA channel will increment from one read address to the next between subsequent transfers, but it will always write to the same write address.\n",
    "- I called the function that I created to configure the DMA timer 0. In this case, I called it with the value 0x0017ffff. This will configure the timer to overflow at (0x0017 / 0xffff) \\* sys_clk Hz, or (23 / 65535) \\* sys_clk Hz. With a default sys_clk of 125MHz, this gives us (3.51e-4) \\* (125MHz) $\\approx$ 43,870 Hz.\n",
    "- I set the transfer request signal to Timer 0 by making the second argument of `channel_config_set_dreq` 0x3b.\n",
    "- I chained the control channel to the data channel. By calling `channel_config_set_chain_to(&c2, ctrl_chan);`, the control dma channel will start *automatically* when the data channel finishes.\n",
    "- Finally, I called `channel_config_set_ring(&c2, false, 9);`. The first argument is a pointer to the dma config structure `c2`. The second argument being `false` means that I am configuring read addresses (`true` here would instead configure a wrap boundary for write addresses). And finally, I specifed a 1 << 9 byte boundary on the read pointer. This means that the read address wraps on a (512-byte) boundary, so that the data channel reads the same array from beginning to end when it is next triggered. Why 512 bytes? The sine table is 256 elements long, each element is a 16-bit short, which is 2 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I started the control DMA channel. This will write to a triggered control register of the data channel, starting the first transfer of the the sine table out to the DAC. When the data channel completes, it triggers the control channel again (because I've chained the two). This starts the process over, and the two DMA channels ping-pong off of one another indefinitely."

Therefore, I used the following algorithm to calculate the timer value:\n",

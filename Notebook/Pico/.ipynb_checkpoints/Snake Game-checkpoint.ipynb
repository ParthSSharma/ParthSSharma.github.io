    "\n",
    "This program was my attempt recreate the [Snake game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) on the RaspberryPi Pico using Prof. Hunter Adam's [VGA Library](https://vha3.github.io/Pico/VGA/VGA.html) for the RaspberryPi Pico. The game is controlled using pushbuttons attached to 4 different GPIO pins(one for each direction the snake can move in. The resources for the project include the [C SDK User Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and Prof. Hunter's [website](https://vha3.github.io/).\n",

    "First and foremost, the snake is implemented in the form of a linked list. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. Each node in our snake linked list holds the x-coordinate of the node, the y-coordinate of the node and the pointer to the next node. Therefore, moving the snake is nothing more than shifting the data of the nodes of the linked list.\n",

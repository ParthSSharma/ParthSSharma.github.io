    "The code has a [VGA library](https://vha3.github.io/Pico/VGA/VGA.html) which has been explained really nicely by Prof. Adams, the [Bitmap header file](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2021/pss242_sp2544/pss242_sp2544/BitMap.h) and the main file. I have explained the working of the Dino game [here](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2021/pss242_sp2544/pss242_sp2544/index.html). The bitmap function I used for the PIC32 version has been described [here](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2021/pss242_sp2544/pss242_sp2544/index.html#Optimization-of-the-predefined-bitmap-function). I modified it slightly to use VGA library provided. Lastly, I used [this software](https://lcd-image-converter.riuson.com/en/about/) to create the bitmaps."

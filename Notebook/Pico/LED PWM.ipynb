    "### The PWM wrap handler\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wrapHandler()` is the function that is called every time the PWM timer throws an interrupt. This function has two `static` variables: `fade` and `rise`. The `fade` variable is used to keep a track of the brightness level of the LED. The `rise` variable is used to keep a track of the state whether the LED is fading in or fading out. Since I wanted the change in brightness to be linearly visible, I used the square of the fade value to determine the duty cycle. I used the `pwm_set_gpio_level()` function to change the duty cycle. Since the PWM in the RP2040 is 16-bit wide, it can take in values from 0 to 65536. If the input value is 0 then the duty cycle is 0% while if the input is 65536, the duty cycle is 100% (only if the PWM wrapping is set to be 0xFFFF). Every time the handler function is called, the values of the `fade` and `rise` variables are updated and the sent into the `pwm_set_gpio_level()` function to change the duty cycle.\n",

Next, I used the `pwm_clear_irq()` to clear the interrupt on the given PWM slice. This allows me to enable the PWM interrupt on the given slice using the function `pwm_set_irq_enabled()`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that the interrupt was setup, it was time to configure the PWM. In order to do so, I used the `pwm_get_default_config()` function to get the default configurations for the PWM. According to the [SDK documentation](https://raspberrypi.github.io/pico-sdk-doxygen/group__hardware__pwm.html#gad76f94a6dd6133c52284b6be8ae98e16) \"PWM config is free running at system clock speed, no phase correction, wrapping at 0xffff, with standard polarities for channels A and B.\" Right now, the PWM interrup will be thrown every single clock cycle. In order to avoid that, I used the `pwm_config_set_clkdiv()` function to set the clock divider to 4 so that the PWM interrupt is thrown every 4 clock cycles. Lastly, I initialized the PWM with the set configurations using the `pwm_init()` function."

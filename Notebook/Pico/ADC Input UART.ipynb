    "# ADC Input UART\n",
    "\n",
    "This program was an introduction to digital input in order to control the number of LEDs glowing while simultaneously controlling their brightness based on ADC input from a 3-pin potentiometer. This was also an introduction to the output using UART. The resources for the project include the [C SDK User Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and Prof. Hunter's [website](https://vha3.github.io/).\n",

    "The RaspberryPi Pico has a 12-bit ADC. That means that the range of ADC input is 0 to 4095 for the given voltage range (0-3.3V here). Then, I used this input to control the brightness of the LED. Since the maximum of ADC input is 4095 and the maximum PWM interrupt cycles in a signal is 65536, I chose a multiplier of 16 in order to scale the ADC input to the duty cycle.\n",

    "### The PWM wrap handler\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wrapHandler()` is the function that is called every time the PWM timer throws an interrupt. I cleared the interrupt as soon as the interrupt handler is called. Since I wanted to change the brightness according to the input from the ADC, I used a multiplier of 16 in order to scale the ADC input to the duty cycle. I used the `pwm_set_gpio_level()` function to change the duty cycle. Since the PWM in the RP2040 is 16-bit wide, it can take in values from 0 to 65536. If the input value is 0 then the duty cycle is 0% while if the input is 65536, the duty cycle is 100% (only if the PWM wrapping is set to be 0xFFFF). Every time the handler function is called, the new brightness level is sent into the `pwm_set_gpio_level()` function to change the duty cycle of the required number of pins. For the rest of the pins, the duty cycle is set to 0."

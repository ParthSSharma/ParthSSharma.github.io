    "# Multi Core Performance Compare\n",
    "\n",
    "RP2040 has Dual Cortex M0+ processor cores which can run upto 133MHz independent of each other. However, the second core (core 1) is asleep on boot and needs to be waken up by a function call from the first core (core 0). This program compares the performance of the two cores by incrementing two different variables on each core. The resources for the project include the [C SDK User Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and Prof. Hunter's [website](https://vha3.github.io/).\n",

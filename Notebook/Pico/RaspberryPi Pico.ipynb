    "The Raspberry Pi Pico is a tiny, fast, and versatile board built using RP2040, a brand new microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi foundation. It features:\n",
    "- Dual-core Arm Cortex M0+ processor, flexible clock running up to 133 MHz\n",
    "- 264KB of SRAM, and 2MB of on-board Flash memory\n",
    "- Low-power sleep and dormant modes\n",
    "- Drag-and-drop programming using mass storage over USB\n",
    "- 26 × multi-function GPIO pins\n",
    "- 2 × SPI, 2 × I2C, 2 × UART, 3 × 12-bit ADC, 16 × controllable PWM channels\n",
    "- An on-board temperature sensor\n",
    "- 8 × Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines for custom peripheral support\n",
    "- Support for C and Python\n",

    "## Programming the Pico\n",
    "The Raspberry Pi Pico can be programmed using **C** as well as the **Python** programming language. I chose to program using C because of the following reasons:\n",
    "1. A C program is compiled, and is thus faster than Python.\n",
    "2. I have more experience working with C and is therefore more comfortable for me.\n",

    "# ADC Input\n",
    "\n",
    "This program was an introduction to ADC input in order to control the brightness of an LED connected to a GPIO pin. A 3-pin potentiometer was used to control the input to the ADC of the Pico. This was also an introduction to the input on a GPIO pin. The resources for the project include the [C SDK User Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and Prof. Hunter's [website](https://vha3.github.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The RaspberryPi Pico has a 12-bit ADC. That means that the range of ADC input is 0 to 4095 for the given voltage range (0-3.3V here). Then, I used this input to control the brightness of the LED. Since the maximum of ADC input is 4095 and the maximum PWM interrupt cycles in a signal is 65536, I chose a multiplier of 16 in order to scale the ADC input to the duty cycle.\n",

    "### The PWM wrap handler\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wrapHandler()` is the function that is called every time the PWM timer throws an interrupt. I cleared the interrupt as soon as the interrupt handler is called. Since I wanted to change the brightness according to the input from the ADC, I used a multiplier of 16 in order to scale the ADC input to the duty cycle. I used the `pwm_set_gpio_level()` function to change the duty cycle. Since the PWM in the RP2040 is 16-bit wide, it can take in values from 0 to 65536. If the input value is 0 then the duty cycle is 0% while if the input is 65536, the duty cycle is 100% (only if the PWM wrapping is set to be 0xFFFF). Every time the handler function is called, the new brightness level is sent into the `pwm_set_gpio_level()` function to change the duty cycle."

In order to avoid that, I used the `pwm_config_set_clkdiv()` function to set the clock divider to 4 so that the PWM interrupt is thrown every 4 clock cycles.

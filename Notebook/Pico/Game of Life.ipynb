    "# Game of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "This program was my attempt recreate the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) on the RaspberryPi Pico using Prof. Hunter Adam's [VGA Library](https://vha3.github.io/Pico/VGA/VGA.html) for the RaspberryPi Pico. The program starts with randomly placing alive and dead cells on a board and calculating the next generation of the based on the current generation. For this purpose, I used two boards, one to hold the current generation and the other to hold the next generation. Once the new generation is completely worked out, it is overwritten into the old board. The resources for the project include the [C SDK User Guide](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/raspberry-pi-pico-c-sdk.pdf), the [RP2040 Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf) and Prof. Hunter's [website](https://vha3.github.io/).\n",

    "#### Rules of Game of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), the universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n",
    "- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n",
    "- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n",
    "- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, live or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.\n",

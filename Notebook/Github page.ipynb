    "> - It was another project I worked on at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. It involved me disrupting the data in a CAN bus communication system taking place between two different microgrids (simulated using an OpalRT system) by first reading the data packets and then disrupting the system by spoofing corrupted data.\n",

    "> - I worked on a fully functioning model of a coin operated mobile charging station. There is a coin slot through which coins are inserted. Then the coin’s radius is measured using a camera (with an algorithm running on MATLAB) and the appropriate amount of charge time is loaded to the microcontroller which is also connected to an LCD display which shows the remaining charge time to the user.\n",

    "> - Recognising number plates using Neural Networks is computationally expensive. Thus, in order to save processing power, we worked on the recognition of the characters of a number plate using Haar Cascades and PyTesseract. Using our method, we were able to achieve an accuracy as high as 94.4%.\n",

    "## High frequency AC switching using TRIACS\n",
    "> - This is a subset of \"Optimisation of power supply and demand parameters\"\n",
    "> - I worked on developing an easy to install module that can control up-to 4 appliances over the internet. I used TRIACS and designed a circuit using optocouplers and NodeMCU in order to switch the appliances. I also created an android application using **MIT App Inventor**, a desktop GUI using **Processing** and integrated everything using **Google Firebase**.\n",

    "## Implementation of Alexnet for self-driving car\n",
    "> - This project was a part of my senior thesis during my undergraduate studies.\n",
    "> - During the final semester of my undergraduate studies, I created a rudimentary version of a prototype self driving car using RaspberryPi and Alexnet. I first built a simple single lane track to run my model car on, used a controller and a RaspberryPi camera module to record the image data and commands sent by me and then trained a model. Then I downloaded the model on RaspberryPi and ran the model. The accuracy achieved was roughly 92%.\n",

    "## Hand Motion Controlled Quadpod Robot\n",
    "> - This project was a part of my junior thesis during my undergraduate studies.\n",
    "> - During the second last semester of my undergraduate studies, I created a Quadpod robot that can be controlled wirelessly using hand gestures. It consists of two modules: the Quadpod and the Controller. The controller has an accelerometer and a gyroscope which sends the orientation of the hand over to the Quadpod via Bluetooth and the Quadpod reacts accordingly.\n",

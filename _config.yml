  Hi, my name's Parth and I'm currently pursuing Masters of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Cornell University. My area of specialization is Embedded Systems. Before studying at Cornell, I was a Research Associate in the Centre for Energy Studies (CES) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Embedded Systems</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

          I worked on optimising the power supply and demand parameters using first <mark>Gurobi</mark> and the genetic algorithms using <mark>JAVA</mark>. My work was mostly programming the algorithms developed by my professors and supervisors (PhD students).

          I worked on developing an easy to install module that can control up-to 4 appliances over the internet. I used TRIACS and designed a circuit using optocouplers and NodeMCU in order to switch the appliances. I also created an android application using <mark>MIT App Inventor</mark> and integrated everything using <mark>Google Firebase</mark>.

          It was another project I worked on at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. It involved me disrupting the data in a CAN bus communication system taking place between two different microgrids (simulated using an OpalRT system) by first reading the data packets and then disrupting the system by spoofing corrupted data.

          This project was a part of my senior thesis during my undergraduate studies.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During the final semester of my undergraduated studies, I created a rudimentary version of a prototype self driving car using RaspberryPi and Alexnet. I first built a simple single lane track to run my model car on, used a controller and a RaspberryPi camera module to record the image data and commands sent by me and then trained a model. Then I downloaded the model on RaspberryPi and ran the model. The accuracy achieved was roughly 92%.

          This project was a part of my junior thesis during my undergraduate studies.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During the second last semester of my undergraduated studies, I created a Quadpod robot that can be controlled wirelessly using hand gestures. It consists of two modules: the Quadpod and the Controller. The controller has an accelerometer and a gyroscope which sends the orientation of the hand over to the Quadpod via Bluetooth and the Quadpod reacts accordingly.

          This is a hobby project I worked on.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This was a simple hobby project that I worked on using a sound sensor and a NeoPixel LED strip. I hooked up the NeoPixel LED strip in such a way that it would react to the the intensity of sound in the surrounding. Moreover, I programmed it such that it would be smoothened out instead of giving an instantaneous value.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
